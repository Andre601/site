title: Configuring Velocity
---

Velocity is simple and unambiguous to configure.

## The configuration file

All Velocity settings in the `velocity.toml` file. This file is located in the directory where you started
the proxy.
 
## The configuration format

Before we continue, it is useful to take a step back and note that Velocity uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format for its
configuration. TOML is easy to understand, so you should not have difficulty understanding
Velocity's configuration file.

## Root section

These settings mostly cover the basic, most essential settings of the proxy.

| Setting Name          | Type    | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``config-version``    | String  | ``1.0``                   | This is the current config version used by Velocity. you should not alter this setting.                                                                                                                          |
| ``bind``              | Address | ``0.0.0.0:25577``         | This tells the proxy to accept connections on a specific IP. By default, Velocity will listen for connections on all IP addresses on the computer on port 25577                                                  |
| ``motd``              | Chat    | ``&3A Velocity Server``   | This allows you to change the message shown to players when they add your server to their server list. You can use legacy Minecraft color codes or JSON chat.                                                    |
| ``show-max-players``  | Integer | ``500``                   | This allows you to customize the number of "maximum" players in the  player's server list. Note that Velocity doesn't have a maximum number of players it supports.                                              |
| ``forwarding-secret`` | String  | Randomly generated string | This setting is used as a secret to ensure that player info forwarded by Velocity comes from your proxy and not from someone pretending to run Velocity. See the "Player info forwarding" section for more info. |
| ``announce-forge``    | Boolean | ``false``                 | This setting determines whether Velocity should present itself as a Forge/FML-compatible server. By default, this is disabled.                                                                                   |


## `server` section

| Setting Name  | Type    | Default                             | Description                                                                                                                |
|---------------|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A server name | Address | See the default configuration below | This makes the proxy aware of a server that it can connect to.                                                             |
| `try`         | Array   | `["lobby"]`                         | This specifies what servers Velocity should try to connect to upon player login and when a player is kicked from a server. |


## `forced-hosts` section

| Setting Name 	| Type     	| Default                              	| Description                                                                                                                                        	|
|--------------	|----------	|--------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| A host name  	| Hostname 	| See the default configuration below. 	| This configures the proxy to create a forced host for the specified hostname. An array of servers to try for the specified hostname is the value.  	|


## `advanced` section

| Setting name            	| Type    	| Default 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	|
|-------------------------	|---------	|---------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `compression-threshold` 	| Integer 	| 256     	| This is the minimum size (in bytes) that a packet has before the proxy compresses it. Minecraft uses 256 bytes by default.                                                                                                                                                                    	|
| `compression-level`     	| Integer 	| -1      	| This setting indicates what `zlib` compression level the proxy should use to compress packets. The default value uses the default zlib level, which is dependent on the zlib version. This number goes from `0` to `9`, where `0` means no compression and `9` indicates maximum compression. 	|
| `login-ratelimit`       	| Integer 	| 3000    	| This setting determines the minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) that must pass before a connection from the same IP address will be accepted by the proxy. A default value of `0` disables the rate limit.                                                                               	|
| `connection-timeout`    	| Integer 	| 5000    	| This setting determines how long the proxy will wait to connect to a server before timing out.                                                                                                                                                                                                	|
| `read-timeout`          	| Integer 	| 300000  	| This setting determines how long the proxy will wait to receive data from the server before timing out. If you use Forge, you may need to increase this setting.                                                                                                                              	|
| `proxy-protocol`        	| Boolean 	| false   	| This setting determines whether or not Velocity should receive HAProxy PROXY messages. If you don't use HAProxy, leave this setting off.                                                                                                                                                      	|

## `query` section

| Setting name   	| Type    	| Default  	| Description                                                                                                              	|
|----------------	|---------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `enabled`      	| Boolean 	| `false`  	| Whether or not Velocity should reply to GameSpy 4 (Minecraft query protocol) requests. You can usually leave this false. 	|
| `port`         	| Number  	| `25577`  	| Specifies which port that Velocity should listen on for GameSpy 4 (Minecraft query protocol) requests.                   	|
| `map`          	| String  	| Velocity 	| Specifies the map name to be shown to clients.                                                                           	|
| `show-plugins` 	| Boolean 	| false    	| Whether or not Velocity plugins are included in the query responses.                                                     	|

## `metrics` section

| Setting name  	| Type    	| Default                 	| Description                                                                                                 	|
|---------------	|---------	|-------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `enabled`     	| Boolean 	| `true`                  	| Whether or not Velocity should send metrics to bStats.                                                      	|
| `id`          	| UUID    	| Randomly generated UUID 	| A randomly generated UUID that uniquely identifies your Velocity server. You should not alter this setting. 	|
| `log-failure` 	| Boolean 	| `false`                 	| Whether or not Velocity should log whenever it fails to connect to bStats.                                  	|


## The default configuration

Below is the default configuration file for Velocity, `velocity.toml`.

```toml

# Config version. Do not change this
config-version = "1.0"

# What port should the proxy be bound to? By default, we'll bind to all addresses on port 25577.
bind = "0.0.0.0:25577"

# What should be the MOTD? This gets displayed when the player adds your server to
# their server list. Legacy color codes and JSON are accepted.
motd = "&3A Velocity Server"

# What should we display for the maximum number of players? (Velocity does not support a cap
# on the number of players online.)
show-max-players = 500

# Should we authenticate players with Mojang? By default, this is on.
online-mode = true

# Should we forward IP addresses and other data to backend servers?
# Available options:
# - "none":   No forwarding will be done. All players will appear to be connecting from the
#             proxy and will have offline-mode UUIDs.
# - "legacy": Forward player IPs and UUIDs in a BungeeCord-compatible format. Use this if
#             you run servers using Minecraft 1.12 or lower.
# - "modern": Forward player IPs and UUIDs as part of the login process using Velocity's
#             native forwarding. Only applicable for Minecraft 1.13 or higher.
player-info-forwarding-mode = "NONE"

# If you are using modern IP forwarding, configure an unique secret here.

# Announce whether or not your server supports Forge. If you run a modded server, we
# suggest turning this on.

map = "Velocity"

# Whether plugins should be shown in query response by default or not
show-plugins = false

[metrics]
# Whether metrics will be reported to bStats (https://bstats.org).
# bStats collects some basic information, like how many people use Velocity and their
# player count. We recommend keeping bStats enabled, but if you're not comfortable with
# this, you can turn this setting off. There is no performance penalty associated with
# having metrics enabled, and data sent to bStats can't identify your server.
enabled = true

# A unique, anonymous ID to identify this proxy with.
