The expectation is that if the\nserver generally acts like vanilla, Velocity will work, and we make special provisions for\nmodded setups where we can.</p>\n<h2>Compatible game versions</h2>\n<p>As of this writing, Velocity is compatible with Minecraft 1.7.2 through 1.16.1 (for Velocity 1.1.0).\nFor Velocity 1.0.x, Velocity supports Minecraft 1.8 through 1.16.1.</p>\n<h2>Vanilla setups</h2>\n<p>Velocity is best-tested with implementations derived from the vanilla server by Mojang\nthat do not add content to the game itself.</p>\n<h3>Vanilla servers</h3>\n<p>The Mojang vanilla software is in a complicated position. It is useful as we often produce\nprotocol updates using the Mojang server for testing, but in production setups, the lack of\nforwarding can induce subtle client problems.</p>\n<p>If you plan to run a vanilla server, <strong>the Velocity team strongly recommends that you use Fabric\nwith the FabricProxy mod</strong>. Fabric and FabricProxy do not by themselves change the vanilla experience,\nand your server will remain compatible with vanilla clients. If you are unable (or unwilling)\nto run Fabric, <a href=\"https://github.com/ME1312/VanillaCord\">VanillaCord</a> allows you to use legacy\nBungeeCord forwarding.</p>\n<h3>Spigot</h3>\n<p>Spigot is not well-tested with Velocity. However, it is based on vanilla and as it is the base\nfor Paper, it is relatively well-supported.</p>\n<p>Spigot does not support Velocity's modern forwarding, but does support legacy BungeeCord\nforwarding.</p>\n<h3>Paper</h3>\n<p>We actively test Velocity with Paper. Velocity works with all versions of Paper from 1.7.10 to\nthe latest 1.16.1 version.</p>\n<p>You can use Velocity's modern forwarding if you run Paper 1.13.2 or higher. If you use Paper\n1.12.2 or lower, you must use legacy BungeeCord-style forwarding.</p>\n<h3>SpongeVanilla</h3>\n<p>SpongeVanilla is compatible with legacy BungeeCord-style forwarding. Our Sponge support largely\nfocuses on Forge compatibility, see below for more information.</p>\n<h2>Modded setups</h2>\n<h3>Fabric</h3>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricproxy\">FabricProxy</a>. FabricProxy supports\nmodern Velocity forwarding and legacy BungeeCord forwarding.</p>\n<h3>Minecraft Forge (1.13 and above)</h3>\n<p><strong>Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.13+ is not compatible with Velocity</strong> due to changes made in\nthe handshake protocol that are difficult for proxies to adapt to. We plan to add support but\nthis is not currently a priority.</p>\n<h3>Minecraft Forge (1.7.2-1.12.2)</h3>\n<p>Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.7.2-1.12.2 is fully compatible with Velocity, as we make special\nprovisions to synchronize client state with each server. However, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend the\nuse of SpongeForge, as it allows you to use legacy BungeeCord player info forwarding and generally\nimproves proxy support in general.</p>\n<p>Velocity does not support Forge-Bukkit hybrids - they have caused several issues, and the design of\nthe Bukkit API precludes any notion of sane mod support.</p>\n<h2>Proxy-behind-proxy (BungeeCord/Waterfall, Velocity, ...)</h2>\n<p>These setups are <em>completely unsuppported</em>. You are best advised to avoid them, as they can cause\nlots of issues. Most proxy-behind-proxy setups are either illogical in the first place or can be handled\nmore gracefully by better, more scalable and performant solutions.</p>\n<h2>Other Implementations</h2>\n<p>This is, naturally, not an exhaustive list. Alternative implementations of the Minecraft protocol may\nor may not work. We encourage you to experiment and to contribute back with your results.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Server Compatibility"},"excerpt":"Velocity is compatible with many server implementations.
