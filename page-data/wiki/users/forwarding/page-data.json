It forwards all player information in an efficient binary format and\nemploys a MAC code to make it much more difficult to trick the server into impersonating your Velocity proxy.\nHowever, it is only available for Minecraft 1.13 or higher.</p>\n<p>To use modern forwarding with any supported server implementation, set the <code class=\"language-text\">player-info-forwarding</code> setting in\n<code class=\"language-text\">velocity.toml</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">modern</code>. You then need to ensure your server is properly configured to use velocity forwarding by\nfollowing the steps in the appropriate section below:</p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"caution-header\">\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734487433621668011/736277965142491276/warning_icon.png\"></img>\n     Caution\n</div>\n  <div class=\"caution\">\n      Modern forwarding, while more secure than the legacy \n      BungeeCord forwarding scheme, is incompatible with Minecraft versions\n      below 1.13, Minecraft Forge (both versions for Minecraft 1.12.2 and\n      below and for 1.14 and above), and ProtocolSupport. If you support \n      or rely on any of these, you will need to use legacy\n      BungeeCord-compatible forwarding instead.\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Configuring Paper</h2>\n<p>You will need build 377 and above for Paper 1.13+ to use modern forwarding.</p>\n<p>To allow Paper to understand the forwarding player data, in your <code class=\"language-text\">paper.yml</code>, set <code class=\"language-text\">settings.velocity-support.enabled</code> to true and <code class=\"language-text\">settings.velocity-support.secret</code> to match the secret in your <code class=\"language-text\">velocity.toml</code>. You must also set\n<code class=\"language-text\">settings.velocity-support.online-mode</code> to the <code class=\"language-text\">online-mode</code> setting in your <code class=\"language-text\">velocity.toml</code>. Once you're done\nediting <code class=\"language-text\">paper.yml</code>, reboot your server.</p>\n<h2>Configuring Fabric</h2>\n<p>A mod called <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricproxy\">FabricProxy</a> allows you to use Velocity\nmodern forwarding with a modded server using Fabric.</p>\n<h1>Configuring legacy BungeeCord-compatible forwarding</h1>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">legacy</code> forwarding is the player information forwarding protocol that is used by BungeeCord when enabling IP\nforwarding from BungeeCord. Due to this, it is ubiquitous and well-supported by most server implementations. It has\nexcellent compatibility (supporting version sas old as 1.7.2, released in 2013) and will work with Forge if you\nalso install SpongeForge on your modded server and configure it correctly. However, it is not as secure as the\nVelocity forwarding.</p>\n<p>If you need to use BungeeCord-compatible forwarding, simply set your <code class=\"language-text\">player-infor-forwarding</code> setting in <code class=\"language-text\">velocity\n.toml</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">legacy</code>. You will also need to make sure your server is properly configured to understand the data sent by\nVelocity.</p>\n<h2>Configuring Spigot / Paper</h2>\n<p>To make Spigot or Paper understand the data forwarded from Velocity, set <code class=\"language-text\">settings.bungeecord</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> in your\n<code class=\"language-text\">spigot.yml</code> and then reboot your server.</p>\n<h2>Configuring Sponge</h2>\n<p>To configure Sponge to understand the data forwarded from Velocity, set <code class=\"language-text\">modules.bungeecord</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> and\n<code class=\"language-text\">bungeecord.ip-forwarding</code> to true in your <code class=\"language-text\">config/sponge/global.conf</code> file, and then restart your Sponge server.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""},"excerpt":"Configuring player information forwarding Velocity supports forwarding information about your players to your servers, such as IP addressesâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/users/forwarding/"}}}
